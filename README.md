## ‚≠ê Overview - Who're you callin pinhead?!

This project playfully pushes the boundaries of image augmentation to seriously amp up object detection and give highlight clipping a major upgrade, bringing you LeBron's epic moments like never before.

### How It Works

The augmentation pipeline employs a series of transformations to generate diverse training samples:

* ["Patrick" Imprinting]():
The visual element undergoes random color augmentation, including hue and saturation adjustments, and is scaled within a range of 0.8 to 1.2. This introduces variability in appearance and placement, helping the model generalize to different visual conditions.

* [Dynamic Positioning]():
Augmented Patricks are strategically positioned based on a 2D Gaussian distribution centered on the LeBron bounding boxes, simulating natural variations and occlusions. This helps the model recognize objects despite changes in position and partial overlaps.

### Results & Comparison

We compare the performance of various augmentation techniques.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Patrick significantly boosts detection performance, especially when combined with Copy-Paste. This hybrid approach consistently outperforms other augmentation techniques.

### Highlight Clipping

* [LeBron Detection]():
A fine-tuned YOLO model detects LeBron in each video frame, creating bounding boxes to isolate him from the background. Bounding box coordinates are slightly padded to maintain consistent localization and minimize jitter.

* [Action Classification]():
Clips are processed and fed into a fine-tuned 3D ResNet (R3D-18) model, classifying actions as NONE, SHOOT, LAYUP, or DUNK. Fine-tuning with **Focal Loss** addresses class imbalance by focusing on challenging, rare events. Frame probability scores are smoothed to enhance stability.

* [Highlight Extraction]():
Frames are grouped into short clips of 15 frames. If the average action probability in the buffer exceeds a confidence threshold, the clip is marked as a highlight, efficiently capturing significant moments.
